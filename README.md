# FLO_RFM_Analysis
# 😊 RFM Analysis on Customer Purchase Data 😊
This project involves performing an **RFM Analysis** on a dataset containing customer purchase history. RFM stands for **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary**, which are critical metrics for understanding customer behavior and segmenting customers based on their value to the business. Let's dive in and unlock valuable insights! 🚀

## 📝 Dataset Description
The dataset includes 19,945 customer records with the following features:

- **`master_id`**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **`order_channel`**: The channel where the customer made their first order (e.g., Android App, Desktop).
- **`last_order_channel`**: The channel used for the most recent order.
- **`first_order_date`**: Date of the customer's first order.
- **`last_order_date`**: Date of the customer's last order.
- **`last_order_date_online`**: Date of the customer's last online order.
- **`last_order_date_offline`**: Date of the customer's last offline order.
- **`order_num_total_ever_online`**: Total number of online orders.
- **`order_num_total_ever_offline`**: Total number of offline orders.
- **`customer_value_total_ever_offline`**: Total revenue generated from offline orders.
- **`customer_value_total_ever_online`**: Total revenue generated from online orders.
- **`interested_in_categories_12`**: Categories the customer is interested in (e.g., Women's Wear, Activewear).

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Calculate RFM Metrics**:
   - **Recency**: Days since the last order.
   - **Frequency**: Total number of purchases (online + offline).
   - **Monetary**: Total revenue generated by the customer (online + offline).

2. **Segment Customers**:
   Use RFM scores to group customers into segments such as:
   - **Champions** 😊
   - **At-risk customers** 😟
   - **Potential Loyalists** 💡

3. **Generate Insights**:
   Provide actionable business insights based on RFM segmentation.

## 📊 Key Insights from RFM Analysis

### Overall Customer Segments
- **Champions**: Customers with frequent purchases, recent activity, and high monetary value. 😊
- **Loyal Customers**: Customers with consistent purchasing patterns over time. 🤝
- **Potential Loyalists**: Recently acquired customers who have made promising initial purchases. 🌟
- **At Risk**: Previously valuable customers who haven't purchased recently. ⚠️
- **New Customers**: Customers with only one or two initial purchases. ✨
